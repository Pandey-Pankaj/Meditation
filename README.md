# Meditation
This contains all the resources related to meditation research including neuroscience, cognitive science, philosophy, computational, signal processing and machine and deep learning. I will keep updating it with latest research and resources.


Meditation techniques are broadly divided into three categories. 

| Meditation Traditions| 
| ------------- | 
| **Focused Attention**: Maintaining a sustained selective attention on a chosen concept or object, such as breathing, physical sensation, or a visual image| 
| **Open Monitoring**: Involves acceptance of internal and external cues with the goal of non-judgmental awareness.  |
|**Loving-Kindness Meditation**: Developing love and compassion for one self and toward all other beings. |
